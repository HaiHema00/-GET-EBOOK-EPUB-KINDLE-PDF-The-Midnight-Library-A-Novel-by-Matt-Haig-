The Midnight Library: A Novel by Matt Haig Book Review

Title: Learn to love being you
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020
Review: I really loved this book!
Highly recommended for anyone who might need to learn to appreciate the importance of little things in life and how they are just as important as the big ones - and how we impact the people around us in little ways that make a difference . About learning to love who you are instead of being upset that you are not who others wanted you to be
I try to teach my students that only "they" know the best how to be "them" - this elaborates on that. I love Matt Haig as a writer anyway

Review: Suicide is a difficult subject to tackle, but Matt Haig does it brilliantly and sensitively in this book. His language is simple but efficient. The text seeps beneath the skin, and tugs at every emotion. I cried lots.

Title: Predictable, Simple, Ultimately Pretty Boring
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2020
Review: Disappointingly trite.

I was looking forward to this book. In fact, it‚Äôs the first book in years that I actually pre-ordered. The premise is interesting enough: there is an ethereal library that exists between life and death. You are permitted to choose any book from the shelves and each book contains an alternative life. Each life is what would have resulted if you changed a single decision you regretted. Interesting, right? Like you could see what would have happened if you‚Äôd gone for that coffee date or pursued that master‚Äôs degree or kept playing piano. In the midst of each new life, if the life-hopper finds herself disappointed, she winds up back at the library to try again. Eventually, you‚Äôll either find a life that is the best possible outcome or your ‚Äúroot life‚Äù blinks you away into death.

Unfortunately, the premise is played out in the most expected way possible. Nora Seed reverses her regrets and realizes that even the best alternate universes have uncertainties and pain and sadness and disappointment. Even when she winds up with her dream job and a great family, she can‚Äôt stay to play this life out. Why? Well, because it isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúhers.‚Äù So, surprise, surprise, she ends up waking up from her suicide attempt with a new appreciation for the life she once had and longed to depart.

If you read the first 30-40 pages of this book, you‚Äôll probably be able to write the rest of it in your mind. It‚Äôs supposedly an opportunity to explore infinite universes, so why choose the most predictable course of actions? To get across the point that you ought to realize the beauty of the life we have around us? Just write a greeting card to convey the message; an entire book is unnecessary. Additionally, it seems like the author either doesn‚Äôt understand or chose not to really explore the idea of infinite options. In all her lives, the most remarkably unique one is granted one sentence of exploration, ‚ÄúIn one life she only ate toast‚Äù (212). Every other life is just variations on themes of work, friends, romantic partners, and family. Of the infinite possibilities available to explore, nothing unexpected happens. It‚Äôs maddening as the author keeps smashing his readers over the head with ideas that anything might happen while never delivering on the promise.

The writing style is difficult to evaluate. It just feels there. Sentence after sentence slowly moving the predictable story forward. It‚Äôs utilitarian prose lacking poetry and depth--seemingly at odds with a book that is attempting to spelunk the internal caverns of a deeply depressed person. The author constantly quotes philosophers but doesn‚Äôt seem to have any real interest in engaging seriously with philosophical ideas. It‚Äôs a novel in form but a cheesy self-help book in content. This novel is a seed of an interesting idea which was never cared for and died below ground. Unfortunate.

Title: A gorgeous, hopeful read

Review: This book is an absolutely gorgeous read! It came to me highly recommended, and I will do the same for you. Read it. It left me feeling hopeful‚Äî as if every regret I‚Äôve ever had means less than the next choice I might make. I‚Äôm not doing it justice at all ‚Äî just sit down with this book and read it.

Title: Never underestimate the big importance of small things.‚Äô
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2020
Review: ‚ÄòWould you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?‚Äô

This was one of my most anticipated reads of the year. It had me at ‚Äòlibrary that contains an infinite number of books‚Äô. Then there‚Äôs my mild obsession with all things multiverse and my knowing that there isn‚Äôt a version of me that doesn‚Äôt end up reading this book. I was so hyped up about this book that I preordered three different versions of it. (Sorry, bank account ‚Ä¶)

What I didn‚Äôt expect was to come to the realisation that I didn‚Äôt actually like Nora. It took almost no time at all for me to begin resenting her for squandering her potential. She was intelligent and gifted in various disciplines but she bailed on multiple opportunities that most people could only dream of having. Even though I also acknowledged and empathised with the pain she‚Äôd experienced, it still took a long time for me to stop being distracted by the privilege she took for granted.

‚ÄòNever underestimate the big importance of small things.‚Äô

I loved the idea of being able to test drive different versions of the life that could have been, although it did raise some questions for me. Some were addressed in this book but others are still ticking over in my mind.

Nora inhabits the bodies of a number of different versions of herself, all living lives that could potentially have been hers. When she returns to the library the other Noras resume their lives. Nora‚Äôs actions in a borrowed life could easily result in consequences that would derail an aspect of the life of the Nora that lives there, and I wondered if I would chance that if I was in her place. I‚Äôd hate to think that me acting in an unintentionally careless way could have real world consequences for another version of me.

If someone who has their own version of the Midnight Library chooses to stay in one of the lives they visit, what happens to the version of themselves who lived there first? Do they die? Swap existences with the interloper? Or is their existence undone entirely? Also, if you remain in another version of your life, could you ever truly feel like you belong or would you constantly feel like you need to fake knowing people that weren‚Äôt a part of your original life?

I did eventually get over my initial resentment/envy of Nora‚Äôs many opportunities and settled into exploring each new possible life with her. There were some lives I wanted to visit longer and others I wanted to escape from almost immediately. It seemed obvious from early on where Nora‚Äôs story was leading.

One thing that I hadn‚Äôt given much thought to in the context of this story prior to reading it was the impact that Nora‚Äôs choices in life, big and small, would have on the other people in her life. In this respect it reminded me of ‚ÄòThe Butterfly Effect‚Äô, although Nora‚Äôs story is nowhere near as dark as Evan‚Äôs. Paulo Coelho‚Äôs ‚ÄòVeronika Decides to Die‚Äô and Robert Frost‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Road Not Taken‚Äô also popped into my mind as I was reading.

I wound up thinking a lot about who my Mrs Elm would be and the form that my Midnight Library would take. While my Library would have books (obviously!), I‚Äôm still not entirely sure who my Mrs Elm is.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible to read this book without thinking about your own regrets. Equally, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible to read this book without considering the changes you could make in your life to erase them.

The story is told quite simply. It seemed to me to be part cautionary tale, part self help book and part Philosophy 101.

‚ÄòNow go on, live, while you still have the chance.‚Äô
